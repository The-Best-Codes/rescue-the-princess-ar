## General guidelines

- Use subagents to work more quickly
- Use the shadcn UI components in `src/components/ui/` when applicable. To add new UI components, run `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add <component_name>`.
- You may run these commands without permission, but do NOT run any others:
    - `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add <component_name>`
    - `prettier --write .`
    - `bun run build`
    - `bun run lint`
- Keep the UI professional and consistent
- Use `bun` as the package manager when possible. Don't directly edit the package.json file unless absolutely necessary, use bun to manage dependencies instead.
